# YouTube Video and Audio Downloader

## Overview
This project is a YouTube video and audio downloader with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using **Tkinter** and **Pytube**. The tool allows you to download YouTube videos and audio files and store them locally, which can then be added to your Spotify local source files.

## Motivation
I wanted an easy way to download YouTube videos into my Spotify local source files, so I could access them on my Spotify account and take them wherever I go on my phone. Many downloaders online either have limitations such as paywalls or daily download limits, making them less robust.

1. Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.
2. Run the script to open the Tkinter interface.
